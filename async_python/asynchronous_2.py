"""
Changes:
    - Add event_loop(): Function with while True loop, which manage 2 other funcs.
        + select.select(to_monitor, [], []) look for files(sockets) in to_monitor list, and return files
            which are in a read_available state.
        + when select returns socket -> check: server(call accept_connection()) or client(call send_message()).
    - Add to_monitor list to store in it sockets(First of all put server_socket in it,
        then after .accept() - put client_socket).
    - Make all functions independent(now we can execute each func when we want).
Result:
    Now we have simple async application.
